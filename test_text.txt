Fun facts about me:
I have over 8k hours in Dota 2.
I've been addicted to roguelikes ever since Slay the Spire happened.
I adore boardgames and cardgames.
For example: MTG, Agricola, Catan, Wingspan, Chess, and more!
If living off just instant noodles was considered a healthy diet, I'd eat nothing else.
And haring, and sushi, and everything spicy, I guess.

Uhm.
How are you doing?
